Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:<br>

I am Avant-Garde, Transformatron Wizard. Long did I wander before settling here.

In fact, my young freind, I am not a wizard of the Ivory Tower. You look surprised! Heh. Think of me as a wanderer who acquired a special power quite be chance... My magic, however, require some very specialized items.

If you acquired  these unique items from the dark wizard in Hardin's Academy, then perhaps I can help you.
