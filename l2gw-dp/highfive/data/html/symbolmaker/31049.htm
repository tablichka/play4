Hello! Isn't it a beautiful day?

Would you like to have a symbol made?

Have you brought dye?

Symbols are not easly made!

You must be certain of what you want before we begin! This is an expensive project and you cannot afford any false starts!

Although expensive, if you choose well, your symbol will be a good investment for you, as valuable as an excellent sword or shield!
