Kamaloka is an invader from another world. Its origins are a mystery, but we discovered a sealed space similar to a Dimensional Rift. We named it Kamaloka.

But before you attempt to enter it, you should know some basic information. You cannot enter Kamaloka alone. Nor can too many enter at once. We have learned that no more than 6 may enter.

There is also a limitation about how often you may enter. The priests say that, just like entering a Dimensional Rift, your spirit needs time to recover from the journey across worlds.

(In real time, you can only enter Kamaloka once pre day.)

You must also have reached a certain level to enter Kamaloka.

Characters must be within 5 levels its level in order to enter.
