*Deceased Character*

When a character over level 10 dies, he loses a certain amount of experience (EXP). and will suffer a gradual drop in ability.

If you have not killed another player, this penalty will not take effect until level 9.

If your Karma is 0 (check status window: Alt + T) or your PKs less than 5, you will not drop items if you are killed during PvP.

(In a non-PvP server, this does not apply since you cannot attack other characters.)
