*Radar*

The purple dot on the radar represents the target you choose.

The N on the radar stands for North. If you change direction, the radar will rotate. The direction of the screen you're watching is the upper direction on the radar.

By using the option button on the top right of the radar, you can set options like "Mark monsters," "Mark party members," "Hide my position," "Fix radar" and more.
