Gatekeeper Largo:<br>

This is the port of the Kamael. Long ago, many goods flowed through here, brought here by ship. But now since people have become more significant than materials, I stand here ready to assist travel.

Would you like to be teleported to the mainland of Aden, where many tribes live together?
