<br> Ah! You wish to have a Dualsword made? That is our specialty! In fact, we can make every type of Dualsword except the A-Grade! <br>If there's anyone better than us, it could only be the legendary <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith of Mammon</font>! <br>You don't have to bring me a stamp, either. <br>Just bring me the swords you want combined as well as Stones of Purity as a fee. <br>Make sure the swords are either Superior, Common or Masterwork. <br>Superior weapons must be combined with other Superior weapons, Common weapons must be combined with other Common weapons, and Masterwork weapons must be combined with other Masterwork weapons. A Masterwork Dualsword can only be made using swords above grade B, which is the lowest grade we work with. <br>Remember that if you invest some kind of a skill in a weapon, you can't combine it with another.  <br>Remember as well that an Enchanted weapon loses its effect once it is combined with another.<br> Which Dualsword would you like? Select one now. <br>
