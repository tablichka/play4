Newbie Guide:<br>

Begin by hunting *keltirs*, *elder keltirs* or *wolves* near the village. The wolves are the most dangerous, so take care.

When you target a monster, the monster's name appears in the upper central portion of the screen. *The color of the name tells you the monster's difficulty*. For now, hunt those that appear in white or sky blue. Those that appear in red or yellow are much stronger than you, so leave them alone.

And I warn you, don't try to tangle with the orcs yet. Orcs are smarter and stronger than you think, but the most dangerous thing is that they know about teamwork -- if you attack one, several others may come to its aid. Even if you might have a chance against a single Orc, you won't be able to stand against two or three.
