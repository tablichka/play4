Newbie Guide:<br>

In the beginning, try capturing *red keltirs* or *gray wolves* near the village. But be careful! The gray wolves can cause problems for inexperienced or incautious adventurers.

Once you have passed level 6, leave the village using the southwest or southeast entrances and challenge the *Kaboo Orc Tribe*. Remember, though, that if Orces see another of their race being attacked, they will join in the fight.

When you target a monster, that monster's name will appear on the top center part of the screen. *The color of the monster's name indicates that monster's strength*. To start, you should only fight monsters whose names are white or sky-blue. Monsters whose names appear in orange or red are stronger than you, so don't attack them recklessly.

Also, hunt near the *Shadow of the Mother Tree* as much as possible. If you go beneath the Shadow of the Mother Tree, you will be healed quickly.
