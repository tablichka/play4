Newbie Guide:<br>

The <font color="LEVEL">One-Handed Sword</font> is the most basic weapon in the game, possessing balanced attributes. The Squire's Sword you began your adventures with was one of these. unless you prefer a specific weapon, I recommend staying with a One-Handed Sword.

You can also use <font color="LEVEL">Fallen Attack</font> with it, which will allow you to strike a critical blow to enemies.
