Blacksmith Karoyd:<br>Elven craftsmen have great skill, without question, but they also tend to be stubborn and elitist. They won't even touch any other metal but mithril! Now, there's no question that mithril is an excellent material: very light, stronger than steel and possessed of a high affinity for magic.<br>But I refuse to be bound by foolish tradition, so I've been researching how to process various other materials. I've already learned the refining methods for Adamantite and Damascus, and I've recently begun studying the processing methods of Oriharukon.<br>
