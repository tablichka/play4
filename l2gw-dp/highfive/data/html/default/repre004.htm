<html><head><body>Rafforty:<br>Is this a Freya Necklace?  Hmm... it's okay I guess.  It isn't as interesting as a Blessed Freya Necklace.  You could be lucky enough to get one, or if you happen to aquire Freya's Soul in a bottle you can create a Blessed Freya Necklace.  However the process is, well... different.  Tell you what, if you bring me these items I can make one for you.<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-2317&reply=2">"I have a Bottle of Freya's Soul."</a><br><a action="link repre005.htm">"Where can I get Freya's Soul?"</a></body></html>
