In a monster race eight monsters race at the same time. If you guess which monster is expected to finish first and buy that monster's race ticket, based upon the odds to win you will receive an appropriate amount of adena.%%
*Racing Schedule*%%
Monster races every 20 minutes in real time.
*Method of Race Participation*%%
You can purchase a monster race ticket through a race manager NPC. Only between 18 minutes before the start of a race until 3 minutes before the race begins you can buy a ticket for the applicable race. When you purchase a ticket through a conversation with a race manager, you can find out the names of participating monsters in the race and their current statistics. Five minutes before a race starts, the race manager will stop ticket sales and announce monsters' individual odds rate for the current race.
*Types of Race*%%
There are two types of race betting. The Win type betting means that you back a monster that will win the first prize. Place type of betting means that you will have to guess the 1st and 2nd winning monsters, regardless of who finishes first or second.
*Win*%%
Among the entire betting amount for Win betting, after subtracting the race track's own share of profit, the amount left will be your total winnings. Three minutes before the race each monster's expected odds are announced. Each Win ticket's dividend amount is calculated by multiplying the odds by the price of a ticket. The odds rate is never less than 1. The prize money does not get transferred to the next race.
*Place*%%
Place betting is a way of betting when you correctly guess the two monsters who will finish first and second regardless of their order. The method of calculating dividend amount is the same as Win betting. Currently place betting is not offered.
*End of Race*%%
When a race is over, the race manager will shout out the results of the race. Through a conversation with a race manager NPC, you can trade your ticket for adena. By looking up on the Winning Information Data, you can find out the types of tickets and quantity of the winnings in the race you betted on and your win status and prize amount you won. If you won, you can receive your prize money thorough a race manager NPC. If you did not win, a race manager will buy back your ticket by paying you a very small amount of money.%%
If a server goes down while tickets are being sold, or while a race is in progress, the race will be cancelled. You can receive a full refund for your ticket for a cancelled race through a race manager.
