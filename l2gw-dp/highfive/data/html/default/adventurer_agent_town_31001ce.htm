<body>Adventure Guildsman:<br>The world is full of violence and injustice. Einhasad has always taught us about peace and healing, while Eva has taught us about nature and harmony. But none of those may be upheld as ideals unless brave individuals rise up and show them in their actions.
<br>Brave people like you give me hope, that peace and justice may be achieved in this world. I will deliver the voices of people who need your help. Will you listen to them?
