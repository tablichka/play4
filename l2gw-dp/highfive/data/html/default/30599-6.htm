Newbie Guide:<br>

If you are a sensible Elf, you must have already realized that whenever you hunt a monster, you acquire *SP* with Exp. "SP" stands for Skill Points, and from now on when you learn a skill or magic power, you will consume these points. You can check your remaining SP points by pressing *character information* and looking at the *status* tab in the pop-up window.
