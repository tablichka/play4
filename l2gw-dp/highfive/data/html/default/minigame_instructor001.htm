<html><head><body>Treasure seeker Sumiel:<br>Success! You've found this room, wandered around this Monastery of Silence for a long time, got lost, got hungry, found your way here now, haven't you? Trust me when I say I don't know where the treasure is. I'd be long gone if I did. But I've had time to look, and I think there is a connection in the turning order of this furnace... I think we can solve the puzzle if we have an item to light. Do you want to give it a try? Tricky part is this, we have to light it within a certain time...<br><a action="bypass -h menu_select?ask=-1&reply=1">Say you will try.</a><br><a action="link minigame_instructor006.htm">Say you don't have time for this jibber jabber, so you want to get out.</a><br><a action="bypass -h talk_select">Quest</a></body></html>
