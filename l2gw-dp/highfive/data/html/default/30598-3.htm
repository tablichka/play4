Newbie Guide:<br>

I suppose you're using the weapons and armor you were issued. That's unless you have rich friends, of course, eh?

Whatever you have is fine for now. Remember to pay attention to what you find while hunting monsters -- you can find armor, and sometimes even weapons, in the wild. If you're lucky, you might find *Cloth Shoes,* <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice's Shoes</font> or a *Cloth Cap*.

You should have been given two weapons, a dagger and a Squire's Sword. Perhaps you have already noticed that daggers and swords perform differently in battle. The *dagger* is swift, but its accuracy suffers, while the *Squire's Sword* is noticeably slower than the dagger, but strikes with greater accuracy. Remember that different weapons may call upon different skills in their use. Either is a worthy weapon; it is up to you to decide which suits you best.

Come back when you have reached *level 6* and we'll talk more about weapons.
