<html><body>Sobling:<br>Ho ho ho.... It's nice to meet a traveler here! Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Sobling and I'm an archeologist. I put together pieces of the past to learn more about how life really was back then. Exciting, yes?! Now I've seen my share of winters, but I still feel a childlike sensation when I excavate somewhere new. I'm just about to explore a giant's cave! Heheee!!<br>
