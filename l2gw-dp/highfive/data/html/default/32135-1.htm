Newbie Guide:<br>

The Newbie Travel Token is reserved for players of level 20 or below.

It allows the player to move to the start town of another tribe via the *Newbie Guides* in each town.

Be cautionus, for in many cases, you may learn and practice certain skills and quests that are unique to the own of each tribe.

Once a player reaches level 20, he is no longer able to teleport using the Newbie Travel Token.
