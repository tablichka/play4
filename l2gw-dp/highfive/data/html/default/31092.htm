Black Marketeer of Mammon:<br>

The Lords of Dawn and the Army of Dusk are now using *ancient adena* coins as currency, saying they are preserving the customs of the old empire.

Tradition and custom! Bah! I've nothing against them, you understand, but what's the use of those old and outdated coins in today's world? Try using them to buy something at any market -- you'll be in for a rude surprise! Don't you agree?

Say, do you have any of those worthless old adenas? As a personal favor, I'll be happy to take them off your hands.

Oh yes... If that special ability attached to your weapon is creating some kind of problem for you, I can even remove it. Personally, I don't really understand why in the world you'd want to remove it after what you went through to gain it in the first place, but mine is not reason why.  Just say the word and I'll take care of it.

Other than that, we have some rare and unique things available for purchase here, so please have a look around. I must warn you, though -- these are hard-to-get items. I'd advise you to buy whatever you can.
