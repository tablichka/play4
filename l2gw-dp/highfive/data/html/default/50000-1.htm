TVT Manager.<br><br>

TvT (Team vs Team) event - the battle between two teams.<br>
The rules of the event:<br>
Teams are formed with randomly picked players.<br>
Killing own's team player is possible, but doesn't add points.<br>
Both teams begin in the Colloseum peace zone where they can receive buffs and form parties.<br>
The battle takes place on the Colloseum battlefield.<br>
Dead character resurrects in peace zone automatically in 5 seconds after death.<br>
The team which gathers most points wins.<br>
Each member of the winning team receives a prize.<br>
A special prize is awarded to the most effective player regardless of the win or loss of his/her team.<br><br>
TvT brings the time you will battle on the one side with your inveterate enemies, and the result of your team depends on your ability to handle disagreements and clashes while the event takes place.<br>
