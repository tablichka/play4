Newbie Guide:<br>

When you reach level 10, visit <font color="LEVEL">Hierarch Kekropus</font>. He will supervise a ceremony which is necessary for you to become a true Kamael warrior.

You should also meet <font color="LEVEL">Zerstorer Marcela</font>, whom you can find at the town entrance. He has been troubled by the increasing number of monsters on Hills of Gold and may want your help to get rid of the monsters.
