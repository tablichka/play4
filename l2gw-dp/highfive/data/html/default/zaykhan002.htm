<html><head><body>Officer Jakan:<br>Ugh, where should I begin? There's a lot to say about this place, none of it good. But if you want to survive here, you'd do well to listen. The Seed of Annihilation is crawling with psychotic monsters unlike anything you've seen before. There are three clans... or races really, I can't tell that they have any social structure.<br>We call them the <font color="LEVEL">Bistakon, Cokrakon, and Reptilikon</font>.

Which do you want to learn about?<br><a action="link zaykhan003a.htm">Ask about the Bistakon</a><br><a action="link zaykhan003b.htm">Ask about the Cokrakon</a><br><a action="link zaykhan003c.htm">Ask about the Reptilikon</a></body></html>
