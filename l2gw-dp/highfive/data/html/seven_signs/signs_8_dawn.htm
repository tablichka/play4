<br>
Even as I speak, the Festival of Darkness is taking place at the <font color="LEVEL">Oracle of Dawn</font>. Speak with the <font color="LEVEL">Festival Guide</font> there for a detailed explanation of the festival.
<br>
If you wish to participate, you must <font color="LEVEL">pay an admission fee of seal stones</font>.

Are you ready to go to the Oracle of Dawn?
