Recipe Merchant Sparky:

Hey, got a sec? I'm too cooped up here! Just take a look outside, see that open sky? I don't know how much more I can take! 

I want to be free! But I have so many customers, I can't just abandon this place. Then again, if I didn't have customers, I'd be complaining about that too! How else would I get news about the outside world? 

Man, I should have listened to mom. I could be a lawyer right now, on a boat, sipping tonic.
