Recipe Merchant Hedinger:

No, I already told you, I'm not Hans! C'mon. How can you say we look alike? My clothes are way more stylish than his, and I'm far more handsome. 

Stop blubbering and just look for what you need. Don't just glance at it, examine it carefully. Hans is the one who peddles overpriced, useless trinkets, not me.
