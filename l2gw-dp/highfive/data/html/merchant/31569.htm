Fishing Guild Member Cyano:<br>This is a good place for those who understand a little about fishing and want to test their skills. You can demonstrate your abilities and show what you've learned here. <br>I'll be happy to buy any fish that you've caught. Remember, you can't catch fish without bait, and you can't get bait without me!<br>
