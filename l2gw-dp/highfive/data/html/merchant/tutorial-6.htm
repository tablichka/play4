How to Fish:<br>

The Fishing Shot was created by the Black Anvil guild at the request of Amfitley, the founder of the Fishermen's Guild. Basically, think of it as a soulshot for fishing.

The Fishing Shot enhances *Reeling and Pumping*. If these techniques are improperly used, the load on the fishing rod and the distance your fish can travel will double. *So the Fishing Shot definitely could have some disadvantages*.

However, if it's used correctly it can make up for any mistakes you make. Mastering Fishing Shot is the final stage to becoming an expert fisherman.
