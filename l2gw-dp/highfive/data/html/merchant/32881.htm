Wahaha! I made it, at last! I'm a genius! 

Hey, adventurer! Do you know what I just made? OK, well, you see, I just... uh... nothing. I made nothing.  I won't let someone copy it, not that there's anything to copy, cause' there isn't. Nothing to see here, nope nope nope. 

Whatever you need, I'll let you look. So just forget what I said before. OK? I swallowed a bug, that's all.
