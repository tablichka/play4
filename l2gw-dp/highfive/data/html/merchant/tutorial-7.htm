How to Fish:<br>

You can sell your fish or cut it apart. You can use its parts to make other objects, or exchange it for a *Proof of Catching a Fish* at the Fishermen's Guild. You can also sell the fish in shops after cutting it up.

You must use caution when cutting up fish. You might find recipes or other useful things, or nothing at all.

Bring us many *Proof of Catching a Fish*, and we'll gladly accept you into our guild and teach you a few of our secret techniques! You must carefully consider what to do with your catch!

Keep an eye out for any recipes you might find while fishing. They are quite valuable!
