Newbie Guide:<br>A <font color="LEVEL">newbie character</font> is the first character that you raise in this world. A newbie character may have the following privileges until level 25.<br>First, <font color="LEVEL">you can exchange equipment. </font><br1>The price of weapons and armor is soaring these days because of taxes and such, but if you sell your used equipment again you won't even get half of what you originally paid for it. It's tyranny! Newbie characters, however, need only pay the difference in price to exchange equipment. It's a great deal! I'd encourage you to visit the weapon and armor store early and often.<br>Second, <font color="LEVEL">newbies can get help with many kinds of supporting magic.</font><br1>Fighting against monsters can be a frightening experience for characters with little battle experience, so I am empowered to bestow upon you the proper supporting magic for your level. My advice is not to challenge any powerful monsters without some magical assistance!<br1><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link guide/guide_for_newbie004.htm">See the list of supporting magic for more details.</a><br>Third, newbie characters are eligible to <font color="LEVEL">receive additional Soulshots and Spiritshots designed just for beginners. </font><br1>Newbie characters will also be provided with special Soulshots and Spiritshots after completing a special quest. I'll keep you notified you about these quests.<br>Finally, <font color="LEVEL">if you haven't yet reached level 6, you can still change races or classes and receive newbie character privileges.</font>Once past level 6, however, your new character will have to be just that. </body></html>
