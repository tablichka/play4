Gludio Ambassador:<br>
<br>
<br>
My Lord, ruler of the Gludio Castle Town, known in the world for his wise and power. He sends you, who own this fortress, a message: "Prove your faith to my castle with this contract!".
<br>
If you don't accept, my Lord will know, that your faith is doubtful. Make your decision!
