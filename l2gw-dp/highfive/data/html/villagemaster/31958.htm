Warehouse Chief Yasheni:<br>

Welcome. My friend! Well, I don't know you either, but everyone who enters my store is my friend! 

How else would I ever find friends?

Don't worry about the item. I'll keep it safe and give it back you later. Even if a thief comes to the warehouse, he won't get your item. Don't worry! No one ever steals from me!
