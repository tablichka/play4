Add Subclass:<br>

You aren't eligible to add a subclass at this time.

To add a subclass, you must meet the following conditions:<br>

First, you must obtain *Mimir's Elixir*. If a character already has three subclasses, he or she cannot add a new one. To find out more about this quest, speak with Magister Ladd at the Ivory Tower of Oren.

Secondly, *your current occupation must be the second or third job and all of your subclasses must be at Level 75 or above.* For example, if your current subclasses are Temple Knight and Silver Ranger, both Temple Knight and Silver Ranger must have reached 75 if you are to add a third subclass.

Thirdly, all characters are limited to *three subclasses*. That is, if any character has already three subclasses, he or she cannot add a new one.
