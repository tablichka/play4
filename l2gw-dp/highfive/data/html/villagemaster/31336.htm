Grand Seer Rahorakti:<br>

Listen carefully what our ancestors whisper into your ears! Look for omens, which occur right in front of your eyes! Feel the danger, that knocks into your door! Eternal will reach us soon!<br>
Do you feel the floating disaster above you? What is it, what must we do this time? If you stand still in your faith, the Soul of Fire will guide you!<br>
