It's simple, really. A change of profession occurs when someone with the required abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced profession. Unfortunately, you cannot change your profession here. However, I can give you some information. Dark Fighters like yourself can change profession to become a *Palus Knight* or an *Assassin*. Which profession do you want to learn about?
