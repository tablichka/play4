Grand Magister Devon:<br><font color="LEVEL">Shilien Oracles</font> are priests of darkness who fulfill the prophecies of Shilen through their study of darkness and death, as well as the spirits of destruction and chaos spawned from Gran Kain. Unlike Human and Elven Priests, who look to the gods of light, Shilien Oracles understand the truth of both light and darkness. As a result, they can not only can heal and protect their comrades through white magic, but also can curse opponents or steal their energy by means of black magic. <br>The most spiritually advanced Shilien Oracles are chosen as <font color="LEVEL">Shilien Elders</font>. The Shilien Elders are our spiritual leaders -- they understand the divine natures of Shilen and Gran Kain better than anyone else.<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link villagemaster/32160/grandmagister_devon007mb.htm">Ask about the transfer to Shilien Oracle.</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link villagemaster/32160/grandmagister_devon003m.htm">Back.</a></body></html>
