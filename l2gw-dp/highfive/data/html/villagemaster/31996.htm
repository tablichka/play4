Grand Magister Javier:<br>

Greetings, my child! Well met! Forgive my exuberence, but I do love to meet an ambitious young Warrior such as yourself!

Ah, the travel and adventure! The thrill of battle and the fellowship of soldiers. If only I had kept to my training when I was younger...

Oh don't worry. I know my job.
