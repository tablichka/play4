Grand Master Bitz:<br>

The *Human Knight* seeks to balance attack and defense, rather than devoting all efforts to a strong attack. Human Knights are known for their spirit of self-sacrifice. With shields and excellent armor, they stand between the monsters and their companions. For your future reference, Human Knights have the opportunity to change to the higher-level professions of *Paladin* or *Dark Avenger*.
