Head Blacksmith Tapoy:<br>

I am Head Blacksmith Tapoy of the Black Anvil guild, here in Gludin. The Black Anvil guild is a proud guild that produces many excellent Artisans and Warsmiths. Any Dwarven tribe without our guild is like bread without butter, or an Elf with no pride. Well now, what has brought you to me?
