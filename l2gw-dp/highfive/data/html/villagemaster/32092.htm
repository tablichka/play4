Warehouse Chief Alder:<br>

Hail! I am Alder, Warehouse Chief of the Schuttgart Territory Iron Gate Guild. What a world, eh? Makes you want to pull the covers over you head some mornings.

How can decent folk like us hope to get by? Every day I hear news of rumors of war, sometimes even between kinsmen of the same tribe! It's all madness!

If there's something that gets me through the day, though, it's this: the bottom line is that every tribe wants prosperity. That means engaging in economic activities.

As long as that's the case, we dwarves are indispensible! No one can match our instincts for trade and moneymaking.
