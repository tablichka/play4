Head Blacksmith Opix:<br>

I am Head Blacksmith Opix of the Black Anvil guild, here in the village of Gludin. Without our Black Anvil guild, Human civilization would be primitive. Can they wage a major war or perform castle sieges without us? Not a chance! Without our siege golems or weapons, those war-thirsty, haughty Humans would have to fight with their bare fists.

But wait, what brings you to the great Opix?
