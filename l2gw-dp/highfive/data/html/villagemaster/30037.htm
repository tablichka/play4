High Priestess Levian:<br>

You are wandering in search of a dream. There are millions of dreams in this world and on the other side, millions of sighs. One day, you too will realize this. How empty dreams can be... However, until then, you will chase the dream like a moth to a flame. What brings you here? I will gladly assist you if it is to reveal the light to you in the name of Einhasad.
