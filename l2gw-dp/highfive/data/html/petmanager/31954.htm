Pet Manager Sharoyan:<br>Did you want a pet? Sorry, didn't mean to startle you! I just have a habit of observing my customers' expressions carefully. <br>As the number of people who interested in raising pets increases these days, the number of people who neglect or abuse their pets is also increasing. I simply want to examine my customers carefully for the sake of the animals. Please don't take it personally.<br>
