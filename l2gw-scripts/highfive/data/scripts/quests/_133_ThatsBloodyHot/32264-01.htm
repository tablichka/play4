Priest Kanis:<br>

Are you interested in Hellbound Island?

I'm sure there are many connections...

Not to mention the people of this Crystal Oracle who were taken captive...

That is because Hellbound is the stronghold of the notorious Beleth...

Is your business related to the Ivory Tower?

Or is it connected to the Giran aristocracy

I don't know what it is specifically, but you should reconsider carefully.
