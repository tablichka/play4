<html><head><body>Sister of Silence Eris:<br>The Seal of Saintess, protecting Solina's casket room, consists of 4 Guardians and 4 Powerful Devices. The Guardians, endowed with power from the Powerful Devices, can cancel any outside damage as long as the Powerful Device is running. In order to defeat them, you have to weaken the power of the Guardians by removing 4 Powerful Devices. It sounds impossible, but there is no other way to meet Solina.<br><a action="bypass -h quest_select?ask=10295&reply=10295">Enter.</a><br><a action="bypass -h Quest _10295_SevenSignsSolinasTomb ssq2_eris_silence_q10295_09.htm">Hear instructions about the Seal of Saintess.</a><br><a action="bypass -h Quest _10295_SevenSignsSolinasTomb ssq2_eris_silence_q10295_05.htm">Uh...
