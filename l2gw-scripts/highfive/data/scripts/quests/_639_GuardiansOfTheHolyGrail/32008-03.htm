Priest Gremory:<br>

What? Damn it all! I have needed an underling for so long...

Well, never mind that now. Let's talk business.

In my searches within the monastery, I have found a *broken bridge*.

Across the bridge, there is a chamber called the *Room of Splendor*.

I don't know what the name means, but... they say the *Holy Grail* lies within.

That's the place to go.
