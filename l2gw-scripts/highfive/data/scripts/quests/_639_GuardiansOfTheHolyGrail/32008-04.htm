Priest Gremory:<br>

The broken bridge? It is simply an optical illusion.

Just step out onto it and you'll find the bridge is intact and whole. I heave a fear of heights, so I cannot manage the crossing myself.

It has been my one and only failure as an agent.

Get me that Grail, and I will *trade you some unique items* which for a part of the *Scripture of Monk* that you are collecting.

Do we have a deal?
