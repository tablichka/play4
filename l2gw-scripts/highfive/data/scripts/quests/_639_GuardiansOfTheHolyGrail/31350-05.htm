Priest Dominic:<br>

Here's the quest: Go to the *Monastery of Silence* and vanquish the monks.

I will give you a reward if you bring me the *Scripture of Monk* as proof that you have defeated them.

I hope, of course, that they surrender to you, but if they do not, you may kill them in good conscience; we will pray for their souls.

Oh, here's something that may help you: we have a man on the inside.

Our brave *Gremory* has managed to infiltrate the monastery, a task many had thought impossible.

Please help him to escape if possible; the poor man has done more that enough, and he may be of help to you.
