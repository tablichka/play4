Priest Gremory:<br>

I infiltrated this order to find the *Grail of Splendor* they keep hidden here in the Monastery of Silence.

Now that's a mission for a man! I wouldn't blame you for envying me.

Wait - if you were sent by Dominic, then you report to me now! Hahaha!

Yes, I've been expecting this. I have served here so long, so very long... the pressures, you wouldn't understand them.

You couldn't. And now he finally recognizes my service and my abilities!

Very well, servant. Your first task will be to massage my shoulders.

I'm weary from hiding in this narrow space for so long...
