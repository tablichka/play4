Hmm... Well, you are not completely wrong, but if you keep on speaking so straight forward, it is likely that you will incur hatred from the authorities and lose your promotion. Regarding that, it is more practical for you to behave as if you are always honest and sincere, at least from the outside. Do you understand?

...Anyway, congratulations! Now you have passed the Trial of the Guildsman. I shall grant you a *Mark of the Guildsman*. It will help you in your promotion.
