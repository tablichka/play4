Warehouse Keeper Valkon:<br>

Good! Then first take this badge. It is a mark that shows you are in the middle of performing the Trial of the Guildsman. Many Blacksmiths and Warehouse Chiefs shall help you when they see your badge.

The content of the test is quite simple. It is *making 7 Journeyman Rings*. It may sound simple but the process of making the ring itself is a test to estimate the Dwarf's ability and wit.

Why does it have to be 7 rings? Actually... It has a symbolic meaning that you offer 1 each to the yet-to-come King of the Dwarf, and the 6 Elders of each guilds. It is a long kept tradition that was kept since the founding of the kingdom and the forming of the union.

If you want to be taught the directions for making the ring, go and see *Blacksmith Altran of Talking Island*. I shall write you a letter of introduction. I expect nothing in return so don't worry. When you finish making all 7 rings come and see me again. That's it!
