Magister Kaspar:<br>

We hope to collect *Baium's blood* from the Tower of Insolence. Surely you have heard of how Baium was descended from King Shunaiman, who received the blessing of Einhasad in person! We must obtain the accursed royal blood from his veins.

If you take this *pipet knife* and cut Baium, you'll succeed. Once the knife absorbs his blood and turns red, bring it to me.

However, if you are scared of the Emperor Baium, you may dip 30 clothes from Platinum Tribes in the Tower of Insolence. That will work too. Which way would you prefer?
