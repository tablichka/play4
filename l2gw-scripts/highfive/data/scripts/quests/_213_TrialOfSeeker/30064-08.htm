Master Terry:<br>

Is the investigation going well? We don't have much time so you'd better hurry. Do you remember who you should catch? They are *Ol Mahum Captains*, *Turek Orc Overlords*, *Ant Captain*, and *Turek Bugbear Warrior*... Catch them and collect the bezoars from their bodies.

I am not sure if it is because of the bezoars, but they are very *aggressive*. Please, be careful.
