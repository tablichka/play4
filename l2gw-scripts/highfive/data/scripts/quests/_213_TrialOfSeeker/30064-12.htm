Master Terry:<br>

How did you behave so that Viktor says he can't believe you?

Did you forget my real name, by any chance? I shall repeat once more! My original name is *Altebar Karryos*. I got my current name 'Terry' from the second letters in my original name.

Anyway, I shall write you another letter. Go and meet Viktor again.
