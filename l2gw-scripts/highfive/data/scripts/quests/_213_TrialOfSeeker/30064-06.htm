Master Terry:<br>

You must need my every word. We each have our own tasks to do. While I am away you myst investigate the mutations one at a time.

They are *Ol Mahum Captain*, *Turek Orc Overlord*, *Ant Captain*, and *Turek Bugbear Warrior*... That's it. I bet they'll also have a bezoar planted in each of their bodies.

The problem is that these creatures that I had mentioned are all very offensive. Perhaps it might be the bezoars that make them so offensive.

But, if it were you, I think you could manage it... Do you need more information?
