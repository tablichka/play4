Since there is no time, I don't think it is a good idea to search for them randomly. Listen carefully.

First, the Ol Mahum Captain can be found *near the Fortress of Resistance* in the north-east.

The next place is Gludio, which is a bit far from here. I guess you can clearly see now, that these mutations sprang out from several places around the world. You will be able to meet the Turek Orc Overlord at the *Orc Barracks* in the northern part of Gludio town.

I bet you have been to the *Wastelands* of Gludio before? It is where there are a lot of huge insects... Find the Ant Captain there. You'll be able to find him better in the underground *Ant's Nest* rather than the Wastelands above. But the Ant's Nest is an extremely dangerous place so you'd better not go in there alone.

And last, the most dangerous of them all... Have you ever seen the so-called Turek bugbears while you where traveling around*Giran*? Turek bugbear Warrior are the leaders among the beasts.

Now then, let's get on with the work. You go there now. I shall follow you soon after..
