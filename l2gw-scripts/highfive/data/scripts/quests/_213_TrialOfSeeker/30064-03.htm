Let's start with one living close to this town. I guess that narrows it down to *Neer Ghoul Berserker*. If you go to the east execution ground, you'll be able to find many neer crawlers. Among them there will be one called *Neer Ghoul Berserker*. Catch him.

And once you get hold of him, see if you can find anything extraordinary. If there is anything at all, come back to me right away.
