Master Terry:<br>

Take this letter and the box containing the bezoars to *Viktor*. 

He is an expert in such matters. Back then, when I was called the Hawkeye, he was known as the clairvoyant. He is quite well known for being an excellent source of information, even to this day. I am sure he'll be able to find something out from the bezpars. He owns a shop at the moment... A very unlikely occupation for him...

Anyway, take this letter to him. Tell him that Hawkeye sent you, he will talk to you. If he feigns a lack of understanding, say *'Altebar Karryos'* loudly. That is my real name. Be the way, he never does anything for free... He will probably ask you for something. In that case, use your own judgement.

I am sure you shall do your best!
