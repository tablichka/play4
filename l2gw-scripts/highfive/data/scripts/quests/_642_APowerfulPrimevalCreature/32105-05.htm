<body>Dinn:<br>Many people are depending on your help.<br>Please go and defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Velociraptor, Pterosaur, Ornithomimus and Deinonychus</font> and bring back samples of their biological tissue. <br>For your information,
one <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Egg</font> and 150 dinosaur biological tissues can be processed as one set of samples.<br>You will be able to find the egg while exploring the dinosaurs' habitat. But be very careful! When the egg is
disturbed, <font color="LEVEL">the nearby dinosaurs will come running to protect it. We do not require as many eggs as biological tissue, so assess the situation carefully and do what you think is best.</font><br>Good luck, my friend! Bring
us as many as you can!
