Magister Clayton:<br>

You have brougth back all the Glass Jaguar Crystals? Good! Then I will create the Blank Book of Seal for you immediately..

(Clayton takes out some arcane ingredients and begins to create the tome.

He grinds up and liquifies the Glass Jaguar Crystals, then uses the mixture to etch in complicated patterns in the margins of each page of the Blank Book of Seal.)

Ah, finished! I must admit to being curious to know what manner of great magic it will carry. I sespect that you are experimenting with a new spell, so I bid you farewell..and good luck.
