Captain Bezique:<br>

You are a very motivated young person. Very well! Now let me tell you what you must do.

Lately, we have been terribly troubled by a *party of bandits* who have been making their way into the village of Gludin. They are taking advantage of the fact that the entire village is occupied with the restoration, and appear and disappear at will to 
steal the wealth of the people.

According to those who have seen them, they are not Humans but ol mahum. They are so swift that the guards lose them in pursuit every time. If you catch the thieves, I will acknowledge your talent and recommend you as a Rogue.
