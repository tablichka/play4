Trader Erinu:<br>

When you enter Nornil's Cave, you will encounter bird-like humanoid creatures called Muertos. Among them are *Captains, Warriors, Archers, Leaders and Wizards*, all of which can be distinguished by their powerful wings.

Some Humans will pay a premium for Muertos feathers, whether for use as decoration in weapons.

*Collect about 80 of those feathers.*
