To secure the fiery spirit scroll, you must go to *Khavatari Rosheek*. He is devoting himself to discipline alone near the *frozen waterfall in the northern part of the Immortal Plateau*. Go to him with the pomegranate that I gave you. If you perform all the tasks that he gives you, you will be able to receive the scroll!
