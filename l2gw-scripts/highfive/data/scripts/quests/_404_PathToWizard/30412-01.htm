Wind Sylph:<br>

I see you have come to find the token of wind. The winds blowing here told me of your story. If you grant me one favor, I will happily give you the token of wind.

Not long ago, *the wastelands lizardman* appeared in the southwest Wastelands, and it has been so noisy ever since that I haven't been able to savor the wind comfortably.

*Please make the wastelands lizardman quiet so my meditations are not disrupted. Then I will give you the token of wind.*
