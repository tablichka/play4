<br>From now on, when your character dies, you will receive a penalty for the character's death. A certain amount of the character's Exp will be subtracted. So, please be careful so that you will not lose your hard-earned Exp due to getting
a penalty for dying. <br><a action="link tutorial_close_0">Close Window </a></body>
