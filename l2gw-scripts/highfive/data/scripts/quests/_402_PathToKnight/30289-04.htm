High Priest Raymond:<br>

I can still hear the despairing cries of my priest brothers who are not yet at rest. *Please find twelve Einhasad crosses from the undead in the Ruins of Despair south of the village and bring them to me* so that I can perform a ceremony to soothe the spirits of the dead priests.

May the blessings of Einhasad be with you.
