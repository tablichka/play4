Trader Kunai:<br>

Ah... Do you also know about the *Fiend Kasha, who causes corruption and death*? 

I know your valor, but I warn you that this mission will not be without great risk. Unless you are ready in body and soul, I fear you will be overwhelmed. Naturally that also means failure for our cause. 

In my assessment, your strength is far too inadequate to undertake this mission. Focus on your training!

(Only characters who are level 15 and above may undertake this quest.)
