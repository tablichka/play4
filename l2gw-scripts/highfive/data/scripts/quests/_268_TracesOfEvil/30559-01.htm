Trader Kunai:<br>

As you know, the creatures that have been contaminated by the curse of the *Fiend Kasha* are everywhere. That's why many creatures near Orc Village are only waiting to die and decay.

But wisdom can perceive the origin of any problem, just like  the spider knows where its web has been disturbed.

We cannot simply wait and watch any longer. I wish to use the vision of the Duda-Mara tribe to divine the reason for this phenomenon. But the task may be too difficult for me to do alone. 

Will you assist me? If you add your power to mine, we might succeed...
