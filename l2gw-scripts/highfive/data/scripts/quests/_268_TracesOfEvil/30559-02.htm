Trader Kunai:<br>

I appreciate your willingness to help our Duda-Mara tribe. There is much to do, so I will tell you about the mission without further delay.

To discover the reason for this disaster, we require a medium. Once the Kasha Spider was our sacred symbol, and even though it has now been corrupted by this fiend, it will still be a suitable medium.

You can find the spiders in the *north of the Immortal Plateau*. Take the lives of the *Kasha Spider, Kasha Fang Spider and Kasha Blade Spider* and bring us *30 Contaminated Kasha Spider Venom samples*. Then I will be able to determine the source of the evil fiend Kasha through this medium. Of course your service in this matter will be rewarded...
