Sir Collin Windawood:<br>

Young Warrior, thank you for recovering my nephews remains and bringing them back here. I give you my gratitude in the name of our family. Now please take the letter that I gave you to *Priest Dustin of Giran Castle Town*. Thank you. May the light of Einhasad lead you to the right way.
