Grand Master Hannavalt:<br>

Greetings. So, you have received your calling? You needn't tell me what it is. The virtues, actions, and responsibilities that you have seen, heard, and felt are the true callings of the Knight. Keep that deeply in your heart.

Accept this Mark of the Calling. May the good will of Einhasad always remain in your heart...
