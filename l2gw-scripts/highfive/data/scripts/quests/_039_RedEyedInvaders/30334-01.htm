Guard Babenco:<br>

I just received a report that a large army of savage *Maille Lizardman* is gathering in the western section of Gludio Castle Town. They're not satisfied staying on the plains.

*Captain Bathis* is recruiting militiamen in Gludio, and we need all the help we can get.

You seem worthy. Would you join us?
