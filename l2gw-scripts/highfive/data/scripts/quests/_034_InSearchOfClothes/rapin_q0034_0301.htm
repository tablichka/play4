<BODY> Trader Ralford:<br>Welcome! Radia told me you'd be coming.  Are you here for the spidersilk, thread and suede? Sorry, we're all out! You can probably get some thread and suede from travelers, but as for the spidersilk, that's another matter! I can make some for you if you help me!<br><a action="bypass -h quest_select?ask=34&reply=1">"I'll help you."</a> </BODY></HTML>
