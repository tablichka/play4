Guard Belton:<br>

You've come back empty-handed. Did you not promise to bring me *harpy's feathers, the teeth of the worm* and *the poison of the medusa*?

As soon as you obtain these three materials, bring them to me. I will reward you for each that you bring back. I've inherited quite a fortune from my deceased parents, so don't worry about the reward. Please don't quit, help me.
