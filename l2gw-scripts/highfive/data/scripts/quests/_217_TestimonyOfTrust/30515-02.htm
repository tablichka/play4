Recently the giant wild boars so-called *Windsus* which live in the northern part of Giran, are making such a racket. The delegation of the Neruga who were traveling to Arden were attacked severely by them. There must be a reason behind the sudden uproar of the beasts. It bothers me that the totem of the 'Lota', the tribe that was annihilated here, had been a wild boar. After the slaughter, the totem spirit of Lota was put to sleep underground. It seems that somebody has awakened that spirit. And that is why the wild boars are making such a fuss. We found this fact at the cost of a few brave warriors from Hestui.

Can you help us solve this matter? If you kill the Windsus, you'll be able to find a small insect-like thing sticking in its body. The thing is called *Parasite of Lota*, and it seems to be the cause of the wild boars' craziness. Collect 10 parasites and bring them back to me.
