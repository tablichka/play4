Tetrarch Thifiell

Good job, son of Human. You have been a great help for the research to free Mitraell, the tribe leader. *Go back with this letter.* It is a notice indicating that we accepted the Humans' request and agreed on the need for trusting each other for the upcoming *Chaotic Chronicle*. But this is just a beginning for the restoration of faith. We shall see if we could continue our trust in each other.

Now go back to your King.
