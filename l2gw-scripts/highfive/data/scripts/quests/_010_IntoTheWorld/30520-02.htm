Warehouse Chief Reed:<br>

I can't believe Balanki fell for it, you silver-tongued devil! I can't believe that you survived, let alone kept your adena! He must be losing his touch! Ha!

You know, I really like you! I'm going to help you, but you must pretend to do something in return to keep up appearances. Balanki considersappearances very important!

Now, did you see Priest of the Earth Gerald at this town's entrance? You should give this to him. He loves it even more than I do.

Try to find out from him who is getting the right to strip mine mithril. I certainly won't blame you if you can't get this information. It's a very sensitive matter. I hope you don't mind me asking this of you...
