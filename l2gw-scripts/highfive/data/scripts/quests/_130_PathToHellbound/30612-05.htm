A *Blue Crystal*...

You ask for the gift I received from the Water Dragon itself when I was young. It is very precious to me.

Tell me, did you think I would simply hand it over to you?

Hmmph!

But since *Galate* asked you to retrieve this not simply to test you, but because she actually needs it... Very well, take this to her. I hope this is the last time our paths cross...
