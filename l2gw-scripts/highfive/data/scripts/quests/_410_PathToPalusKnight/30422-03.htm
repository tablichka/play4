I see you are still in the village. Prudence is good, but once you have set your goal, isn't it the way of a knight to achieve it as quickly as possible? Like when you raise your sword and thrust with your knife into the opponent's heart without wasting any time ...

As I have already told you, you must have *five trimden silk skeins and one carapace of a giant poison spider* to complete the coffin of eternal rest.

Giant poison spiders are fairly common, so it will be easy to find them. You can find trimden if you follow the coastal road that lies to the south of Gludin.
