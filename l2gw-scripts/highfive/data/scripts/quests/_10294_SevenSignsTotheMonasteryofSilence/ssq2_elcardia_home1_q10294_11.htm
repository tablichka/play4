In the Monastery of Silence, there is a teleporter to the Abbot's Room hidden somewhere inside the main room to the library. <br>We have to find that teleporter. As soon as you are ready we will leave for the Monastery of Silence. <br>Perhaps if we look behind the library we will find something. I'll go after you, you go first and start searching.</body></html>
