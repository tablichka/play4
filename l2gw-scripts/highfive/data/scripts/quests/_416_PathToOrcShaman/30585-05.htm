Tataru Zu Hestui:<br>

To master the authority of flame and truly govern the spirits, you must learn two things. First, you must learn the language of flame, which is the language of the spirits, in order to communicate with them. Second, you must learn the names of the ninety-nine spirits, in order to control and rule over them. Without these two requirements, you cannot become a true Orc Shaman.
