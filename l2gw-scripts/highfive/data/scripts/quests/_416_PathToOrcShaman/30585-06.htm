Tataru Zu Hestui:<br>

Unfortunately, the language of flame cannot be explained, nor taught with common language. I cannot teach you the language, but I can tell you how to learn it.

To learn the language of flame, you must meet the Hestui Totem Spirit. The spirit is a divine being, symbolizing dignity and wisdom, taking the form of a kasha bear.

However, to meet it you must prepare a few things. Find and bring me the *kasha bear pelt and kasha bladespider husk*, and hunt the *scarlet salamander* and find the *fiery egg*.
