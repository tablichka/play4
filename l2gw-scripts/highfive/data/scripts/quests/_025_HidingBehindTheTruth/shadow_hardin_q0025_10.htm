It's not easy to conjure an army without corpses, so I opened the door to the netherworld to steal the army of Shillen.<br>While I was preparing, Lidia took Rose's corpse.

In the meantime, I started some experiments.<br><a action="bypass -h quest_select?ask=25&reply=18">"What experiments?"</a></body></html>
