Priest Kanis:<br>

Considering all that has happened, it is clear to me that some evil force is trying to use the Shamaness to obtain the Water Dragon's Power.

It must have disguised itself as a hurt, weak creature and entered the most vulnerable part of the Shamaness' mind.

By the time the Shamaness realized that something was wrong, the evil force had managed to obtain nearly all of the Water Dragon's power.

If the Shamaness were restored to her own mind, however, undoubtedly, feel the wrath of the Water Dragon...

The evil force realized this and acted first by attacking the Crystal Oracle and imprisoning the Shamaness some place where she cannot communicate with the Water Dragon.
