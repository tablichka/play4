Priest Kanis:<br>

They say that a monster named *Balor* rules over the *Water Dragon's Cave*.

I believe that Balor guards the place where the Shamaness is being held captive.

If that is the case, you will only be able reach the Shamaness by defeating Balor.

That creature is said to be far stronger and more fightening than ordinary monsters, so please be careful...
