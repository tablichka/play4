<html><head><body>Singsing:<br>I heard a rumor that Native Shamans will give out <font color="LEVEL">Materials for A-Grade Weapons</font> for only 300 Bones of a Plains Dinosaur.<br>Although lately they have also given out <font color ="LEVEL">S80 Recipes</font>as a reward. It only takes about 100 to 300 Bones of a Plains Dinosaur depending on the type of item.<br>However, you can avoid the entire complicated and annoying process by doing business with me and I can give you <font color="LEVEL">adena</font>for your troubles. The choice is completely up to you... choose wisely.</body></html>
