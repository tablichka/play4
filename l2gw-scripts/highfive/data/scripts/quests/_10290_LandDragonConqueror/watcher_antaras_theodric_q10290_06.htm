<html><head><body>Antharas Watchman Theodric:<br>Yes, Antharas can never really be killed� not yet anyway. You may have heard stories from other adventurers how they have killed him again and again. Each time he is killed, he resurrects even more powerful. I fear that the greed of adventurers has caused Antharas to become overwhelmingly powerful.<br>You will need an army to follow you if you have any hope of defeating Antharas now.<br><a action="bypass -h quest_select?ask=10290&reply=10290">Accept the mission.</a></body></html>
