<body>Priest Flauron:<br> Ha! You surprise me. I hadn't expected to see you again. Not alive, anyway. Did you learn much from your visit?<br> Oh, don't look at me like that. It doesn't matter anyway. You're not experienced enough to take on
this quest, and I am doing you a favor by telling you so.<br> (Only characters who have the Faded Visitor's Mark and are level 73 or above are permitted to take on this quest.)
