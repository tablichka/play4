Guard Jacob:<br>

To make the honey, I need enough nectar to fill twenty bottles.%%
You can obtain the nectar by hunting giant bees like the *bloody bee* and the *great stinger.* But the great stingers are very large and ferocious, so be careful.%%
If you are lucky, you may be able to obtain something called *royal jelly* from worker bees are yet a week. If I add royal jelly to the nectar, I will be able to make a more flavorful, golden honey. But for that I need *10 bottles of royal jelly.* It is such a rare ingredient that you may have trouble finding it.
