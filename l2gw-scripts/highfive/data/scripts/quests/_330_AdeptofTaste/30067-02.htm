Priestess Glyvka:<br>

So you haven't been able to gather all the moss yet. As I told you, you must hunt giant ants like the *gray ant* and *crimson ant* to obtain swamp moss. Bring me *twenty bundles of moss* and I will prepare them for cooking.%%
Swamp moss is usually green, but if you want a truly luxurious dish, you must invest the time and look for *brown moss*.
