He he... I found out about my brother!

My brother said he would stop by at the *abandoned mines east of the village,* and then go to the *east end of the Dwarven kingdom* to praise the work of Lucien. Then, he was going to go see the wide ocean on the *northern coastline.*

But if you want to find him, you will go through some difficulties! Good luck then! (That was some of the best free labor in a looong time. Hoo hoo!)
