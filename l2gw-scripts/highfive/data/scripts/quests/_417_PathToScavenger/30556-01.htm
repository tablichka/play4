Master Toma:<br>

Who are you?

Oh, a letter from Mion?

Hmm... So you want to be a Scavenger?

Do just as I say.

This body yearns for something sweet. What do you think?

My friend says that if you catch the hunter bear in the mines, a *honey bear* comes out. And he said that the honey was wonderful.

Yum yum... Knock down the honey bear and rummage through with Spoil and bring back *five honey jars.*
