Humph! And I was trying to get some free work done in the name of my brother!

You are just as lazy as he is! I would be better off if I did it! My brother said he would stop by at the *abandoned mine east of the village*, and then go to the *east end of the Dwarven kingdom* to praise the work of Lucien. Then, he was going to go see the wide ocean on the *northern coastline*.

But if you want to find him, you will go through some difficulties! Hu hu! Well then, good luck!
