May Shilen's blessing be with all those who search for the truth of darkness... I see you have brought back all five bloody runes. I will combine these and write out Garmiel's Book for you. It is only a small section of the song of darkness that Gran Kain sang in the beginning, but the truth within will develop your realization of magic to a level higher.

Now take this. It is the completed Garmiel's Book. Read its passages as you rest during your journey, and adapt the truth within as your own.

Now you must fulfill the second custom that you must pass to become a Shillien Oracle. You must find *Andariel's Book,* which contains parts of the song of creation sung by the God of Light in the beginning. Take this book to *Priest Adonius* in the temple of Einhasad. He will receive you cordially when you say, *'I have read your book and, being deeply moved, I have repented of my sins and decided to accept the light.'*
