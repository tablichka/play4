Lizardman are using sorcery to turn arachnids into servants! To dispell it, I'll need the gems they are using.

Get *Shining Gems* from *Maille Lizardman Warriors, Shamans and Matriarchs*. *Poison spiders and giant spiders* have *Shining Red Gems*. I need fifty of each. Find them in the *north of the Maille Lizardman stronghold.* I'm counting on you!
