<HTML><HEAD><BODY>Jeweler Ellie:<br> Hi there! Have you met Mr. Felton?
 <br> Since I see you holding the ore, you must have met with him. I think I ordered about 10 of them. If you can give them to me, I will make the jewelry for you. Please put the ore you have up here. <br><a action="bypass -h quest_select?ask=35&reply=1">"Here they are."</a>  </BODY></HTML>
