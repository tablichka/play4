Balthazar:<br>

Ah! Yeah, the thing you guys have to do is bring me Spiteful Soul Energy. To do that, you'll need to go to Fields of Massacre which is in the east of Aden.The degenerated spiteful leaders that are living there are curious creatures that have grafted an energy to their bodies as ancestors of the ancient leaders that had achieved a glorious civilization. Even if their heads have become strange, they are still incredible beings with a physical strength that has no match. However, folks such as yourselves can still find a way to deal with them.

*If you kill the Spiteful Soul Leader*, you can get the *Energy* from the their souls. Note that a vengeance one is no use at all... So you've got to bring an energy that is in good condition.  We'll need *ten* of energy. OK, please do your best. alright? *Oh wait... the coins...? Let me take a look at those*!
