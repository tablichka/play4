You really did a good job! You've gotten all the energy that I requested. I'll take a look...You take a look too. Wow! This is an art. An art, I say! Aren't they really exquisite? I really appreciate this. Thanks to you, our research in the new type of siege golem is back on track! I'll be able to show you the results pretty soon! Ha, ha, ha... You're gonna be impressed! That golem will be so dangerous that it shouldn't be used on just any castle!
