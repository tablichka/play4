<html><head><body>Grand Magister Jurek:<br>It seems that the most evil creatures 
in Antharas' Lair are the <font color="LEVEL">malruk knights, malruk berserkers, 
Malruk lords, Limal karinnesses, kariks, pytans, and pytan knights</font>. 
<br>Remember that you cannot fill your crystal with the souls of weaker 
creatures. The crystal develops a refined taste and demands souls of greater 
evil. If you notice that your crystal has stopped absorbing souls, try killing 
creatures of more evil. </body></html>
