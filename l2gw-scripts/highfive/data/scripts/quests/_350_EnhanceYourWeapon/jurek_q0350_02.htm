<body>Grand Magister Jurek:<br>Some invisible danger approaches this world. I can feel it as clearly as a thirst, and the trees of the forest, the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea all feel it as well. I do not yet know the nature of this threat, but I fear the worst, and this fear refuses to leave me. I can only wish my feelings are incorrect...
<br>I at least want to help prevent the possible threat to life in this world. So I have been gathering people who share my thoughts in order to prepare for that impending danger. But I do not know when it will come, only that it may.
<br>How about it? Will you also lend your strength and be ready to fight the danger that approaches our world?<br><a action="bypass -h Quest _350_EnhanceYourWeapon jurek_q0350_03.htm">Say that you will lend your strength.</a></body></html>
