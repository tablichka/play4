<body>Magister Gideon:<br>You cannot always be successful at absorbing souls -- there will undoubtedly be occasions where matters take a different path.<br>Furthermore, you will not be able to continuously absorb souls from weak evil creatures. If you keep trying, your soul crystal will refuse it. Once it reaches a certain level, it will want the souls of stronger evil creatures. If you think you have reached that point, it is time to set your sights higher. <br>If you try to use two soul crystals on a monster, they will conflict with each other, and you will be unable to use them absorb souls anymore. <br><a action="bypass -h Quest _350_EnhanceYourWeapon guyder_q0350_07.htm">Receive Soul Crystal.</a></body></html>
