Magister Gideon:<br>
Recently I've begun to sense impending doom. The trees in the forest, the birds in the sky and fish in the water all know of what I speak. I don't even know if the human race will survive the coming disaster... I only hope that I am wrong...<br>I hope to at least assure the survival of our race... I am currently in the process of recruiting like-minded people to fight the menace. But we don't even yet know what the menace is...<br>So, what do you say? Will you join our struggle against the gathering darkness?<br>
