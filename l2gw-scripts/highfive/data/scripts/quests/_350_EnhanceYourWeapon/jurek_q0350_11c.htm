If you do so, it can become level 11 (a level 11 Soul Crystal can become level 12). Their souls are so powerful that it is said that the <font color="LEVEL">Soul Crystals of a whole adventuring party</font> can absorb the soul.<br>Level 11 and 12 Soul Crystals can be obtained from Raid bosses like <font color="LEVEL">Beast Lord Behemoth, Roaring Skylancer, Minas Arnor, Eilhalder Von Hellman, Krokian-Padisha Sobekk, Priest Chloe of Antharas, Siren</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Tyrannosaurus</font>. But <font color="LEVEL">it is not easy to absorb their souls</font> compared to Baium, Jaken, Anakim and Lilith, and their souls are weaker -- only <font color="LEVEL">one member of the party</font> that defeated them can absorb the soul.<br>Although you can get level 12 Soul Crystals that way, it is much more difficult to obtain a level 13 Soul Crystal...<br><a action="bypass -h Quest _350_EnhanceYourWeapon jurek_q0350_11d.htm">Keep listening.</a></body></html>
