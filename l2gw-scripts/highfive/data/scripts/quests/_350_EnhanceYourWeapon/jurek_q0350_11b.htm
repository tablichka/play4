<html><head><body>Grand Master Jurek:<br>For your information, if you're using a Soul Crystal of level 10 or above, you no longer need to target a monster before you kill it. A Soul Crystal of this level is self-targeting. In other words, it will absorb souls on its own...<br>Of course, you can still only use one Soul Crystal at a time.</body></html>
