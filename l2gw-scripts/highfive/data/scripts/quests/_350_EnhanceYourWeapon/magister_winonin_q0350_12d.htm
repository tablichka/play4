the Devastated Castle are the <font color="LEVEL">doom servants, doom guards, 
doom archers, doom troopers, doom warriors and doom knights</font>.<br>Remember 
that you cannot fill your crystal with the souls of weaker creatures. The 
crystal develops a refined taste and demands souls of greater evil. If you 
notice that your crystal has stopped absorbing souls, try killing more dangerous 
creatures.</body></html>
