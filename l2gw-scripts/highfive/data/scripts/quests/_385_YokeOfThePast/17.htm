Gatekeeper Ziggurat:<br>

Now go to the dungeon, slay *the guardians of ancient cult*, and bring back the *scrolls of ancient magic* .

When you bring me the scroll, I will remove the magic power it contains and turn the scroll into a *blank scroll*. A blank scroll is the only reward I can offer you.
