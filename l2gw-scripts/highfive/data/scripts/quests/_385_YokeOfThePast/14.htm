Gatekeeper Ziggurat:<br>

Good choice! Now go to the dungeon, slay *the guardians of ancient cult*, and bring back the *scrolls of ancient magic* .When you bring me the scroll, I will remove the magic power it contains and turn the scroll into a *blank scroll*. A blank scroll is the only reward I can offer you.

Have you heard of *Merchant of Mammon* who often appears in the dungeon area? He will be very interested in a blank scroll. You will find out more when you meet him. It wont be easy to find him though...
