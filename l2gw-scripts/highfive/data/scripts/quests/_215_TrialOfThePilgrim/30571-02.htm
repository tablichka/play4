Seer Tanapi:<br>

Didn't I tell you to go to the *ancestors' altar * in the Cave of Trials? I told you to try and pray to the *Ancestor Martankus* to give you the guidelines.

What, are you afraid of it now? If that's the case I won't blame you. Just go back and tell Santiago that you are afraid...
