Andellia:<br>

Do you bring a message from Santiago? In search of the truth, are you?  Your timing could not be better.  

 I have a favor to ask you. There is a Black Priest named *Uruha* in the Neutral Zone. She invaded this forest with her spirits known as *black willow*. You must destroy these spirits. 

The black willow are located near the *Waterfalls in the northern part of the Neutral Zone*. 
*After destroying them, go to Uruha and warn her not to come to the Elven Forest again.* After you do this we can discuss God.
