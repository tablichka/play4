That is quite a surprise! So you say that you felt the flames of Paagrio? Amazing!

To tell the truth, I didn't expect much from you when I sent you to the Cave of Trials. A young man like you these days... I shall remember this.

So now you want to learn about the Maphr? Then go and see *Gauri Twinklerock of the Dwarven Village*! I hope that you will find the light of truth at the end of your journey! Tejakar Paagrio!
