Seer Tanapi:<br>

Santiago... You keep sending me such greenhorns, and it is so annoying! Why do I, the great seer Tanapi have to deal with such novices like you ! Humph! I guess I have no choice...

Do you truly wish to understand the God of Flame Paagrio? Then you should go to the ancestors' altar in the *Cave of Trials* and try and ask the *Ancestor Martankus*. If your wishes are sincere, he will respond you.
