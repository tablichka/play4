Ancestor Martankus:<br>

Hot, hot... My spirt is burning...

This... What is this? The flame of the fighting spirit... A mind that pure fighters have.

What? What is that again? Who are you? What? Ahh!! Don't come near! Too hot! Flame of destruction? It swallows everything and leaves only black ashes... 

Is it finished ...?

No, there's more! Flame exists in ashes... Yes, you! All important holy flame! Energy that moves the earth, the flame of life...

Here, absurdly small being ... Want to feel more? However this is all you can handle... Before your body and soul all burn away... Now it's over...
