Magister Hanellin:<br>

Oh, you've brought me *10 blooded fabrics*! Here, take this reward from me, and I shall give you more white fabrics, because I need more blood to make my experiments.
Remember, you need to dip the cloth in the blood of a *Seal Angel* or a *Guardian Angel*. Once you have made the cloth completely red from their blood, come back to me and I promise to reward you.
