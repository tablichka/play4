The relics are contained in three separate arks. The arks are hidden in Aden, Giran and somewhere in the Dark Elven Forest beyond the Misty Mountains. Here in Aden, *Madam Claudia Athebalt* is searching for the ark. In Giran, a fixer named *Martien* of the Town of Giran is searching for the ark, and in the Dark Elven Forest, *Magister Harne* of the Dark Elf Village is searching for the ark. All three have reported that their searches ar almost complete.

Take these letters with you and find them. They will tell you what they have found so far. When you find the three arks, bring the relics back to me.
