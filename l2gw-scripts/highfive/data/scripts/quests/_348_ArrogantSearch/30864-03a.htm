Magister Hanellin:<br>

You are not thinking about quiting already, do you? Have you forgotten what I asked of you? Here is what I wish of you for now: go to the Forsaken Plains, defeat a *Yintzu* or a *Paliote* and bring back the Shell of the Monster that they carry. I only need one piece, so it shouldn't be too hard for you.
