Master Minia:<br>

There are many orcs on Talking Island, but the lennunt orcs are at the *Elven Ruins*. You will be able to find arrowheads of lennunt orc snipers. If you don't know how to find the ruins, ask Guard Kenyos.

They are not merely for my private purposes, I plan to donate some to Cedric's Training Hall for exhibition, so please bring back ten arrowheads.
