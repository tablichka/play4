Railroad Worker Obi:<br>

This area has gone to hell lately!

The security was never that great, but once there were merchants and warehouses, security gaurds and adventurers...

But that was a long time ago...

Now they're all gone! All that's left is this old, worn-out railroad station and the Bandits who rob anyone foolish enough to come here!

How would you like a job?
