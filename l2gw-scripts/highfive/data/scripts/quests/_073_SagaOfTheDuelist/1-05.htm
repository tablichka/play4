Master Chef Donath:<br>
You need the meat first. Get <font color="LEVEL">Top Quality Meat</font> from the Beast Herder in Beast Farm of Rune. I've spoken with <font color="LEVEL">Beast Herder Tunatun</font>, so he is expecting you.<br>
Then we need an <font color="LEVEL">Ice Crystal</font> to cleanse and chill the meat. Get the Ice Crystal from <font color="LEVEL">Chef Jeremy</font> over there. He won't give you something for nothing, be warned. <br>
Come back with both ingredients. Hurry, my culinary powers are starting to itch!</body></html>
