Master Chef Donath:<br>
Food for Duelists...<br>
I'm willing to discuss this with you, but know that it is a serious matter. It is no ordinary food.<br>
The food empowers you on your way to war, giving you a fierce edge in battle.<br>
Such a blessing does not come easily! Collecting the ingredients for this food is a battle unto itself.<br>

Master Chef Donath:<br>

Ah, the legendary last meal of Duelists!%%
Is it for you? The last dish...%%
Did you know that dish actually contains the resolve one feels before going into mortal combat?%%
And, of course, the ingredients must be gathered by the Duelist himself. Consuming food gathered at great risk allows the warrior to absorb the power of his opponent!%%
If the meal is for you, you should collect and bring back the ingredients by yourself!
