Gatekeeper Mirabel:<br>

I'm one of the few who truly grasps this world, yet I can't claim to understand all the people in it.

I know it's hard to find a place as peaceful as our *Elven Forest*, but the outside world also has much to offer, especially Giran.

We shouldn't just stick to our forest, but interact with others to try and understand them!
