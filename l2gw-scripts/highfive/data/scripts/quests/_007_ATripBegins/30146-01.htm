Gatekeeper Mirabel:<br>

Very few gatekeepers truly understand this world. I've visited countless cities and villages, but certainly can't say that I understand everyone who lives in them.

It's hard to find a place as beautiful and peaceful as our Elven Forest, but the outside world also has much to offer. In particular, an unspeakably crowded place like Giran is full of opportunities.

As a traveler, you must know what I'm talking about.
