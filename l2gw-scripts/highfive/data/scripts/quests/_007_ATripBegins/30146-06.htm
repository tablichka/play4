Gatekeeper Mirabel:<br>

Excellent! I gave you a *Scroll of Escape* to *Giran Castle Town*and a *Mark of Traveler*.

Now remember, it can only be used once, and I gave you my last one! The Mark of Traveler was provided by *Hierarch Asterios*. When you're ready to return, visit *Trader Galladucci* at his boutique. Show him the mark and he'll help you.

You must be careful! *Giran* is a very crowded and chaotic place and there are dangerous beasts there!

May the divine blessings of Eva be upon you!
