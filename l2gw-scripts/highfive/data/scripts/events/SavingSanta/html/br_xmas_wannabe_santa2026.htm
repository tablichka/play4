<body>You're a really brave man of courage. You are the one who will be able to catch that bastard turkey.<br>Let me briefly tell you what to do. <font color="LEVEL">First</font>, you need to take rock-paper-scissors Santa hat I'll give
you. <font color="LEVEL">Second</font>, I'll tell you where the turkey is at. <br>Perhaps do you know the Dwarven Village? Around the entrance of the village, you can find the<font color="LEVEL">Frozen Valley</font>. Just to make sure the
Santa Claus is still captured, turkey will come out once every <font color="LEVEL">4 hours</font>. <br>Understand? That time is a chance. The Turkey will stay only for <font color="LEVEL">30 minutes</font> and then disappear, so don't lose
that time frame. The happiness of this year's Christmas all depends on you!!! I leave it to you!!! <br><a action="bypass -h scripts_events.SavingSanta.SavingSanta:link br_xmas_wannabe_santa2027.htm">Curious about the Event Reward</a><br><a
