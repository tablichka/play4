<body>Oh, something awful has happened! Our Santa Claus has captured by the misguided turkey near the Dwarven Village. <br>I want to help him, but I'm too busy because it's Christmas... Heu heuk. And I'm a Santa Trainee, so I can't hand out
Christmas gifts on behalf of Santa Claus. If Santa Claus could not be rescued, there's no gifts this year~ <br>Please rescue Santa Claus by taking match with the Turkey. I heard the stupid Turkey can't stand to see people being pleasant
during Christmas...<br><br>If you want to take match with the Turkey, <font color="LEVEL">"rock-paper-scissors"</font>needs to be mastered.<br><br><a
