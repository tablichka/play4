<body>I will tell you about the event reward that you can get.<br>First, if Santa Claus is released from the prison, I will give you the <font color="LEVEL">appreciative buff</font>. <br>If you receive it once, hunting becomes so much fun.
Come to me as soon as Santa Claus is released. Also, they say that Santa Claus really appreciates those who try their best. <br>A unbelievable gift will be given to those who fight hard against monsters. <br>I cannot tell you what it is
although you may be curious about it. You can only find out when you open the box~<font color="LEVEL">Wu haha... You can look forward to it~</font><br>Ah! One important thing! <br>If there is a <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Exchange
    Ticket</font> among the gifts, please bring it to me. I'll turn it into an awesome enchanted weapon. Who knows? It may even become a <font color="LEVEL">+10 enchanted Grade A weapon</font> that you dream about~<br>Now, then please get
started~<br><br><a action="bypass -h scripts_events.SavingSanta.SavingSanta:link br_xmas_wannabe_santa2001.htm">Back to the beginning</a></body>
