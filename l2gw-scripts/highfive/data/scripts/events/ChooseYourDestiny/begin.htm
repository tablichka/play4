In commemoration of the Hellbound update, eligible players will have the opportunity to swap 
 their main class with one of their subclasses. Change your main class to one of your subclasses 
 and enjoy playing Lineage II with a character that you love even more!<br>
<font color=LEVEL>Eligibility and Requirements</font><br>
- Each character can swap his or her main class only once.<br1>
- Once you change a character's class, the change is final and cannot be reversed. Please submit your request carefully.<br1>
- In order to participate in this event, your desired character's <font color=LEVEL>main class</font> must be between levels <font color="LEVEL">75 and 80</font>, and the <font color="LEVEL">subclass level must be 75</font> or above.<br1>
- Your main class mast be on <font color=LEVEL>second or higher class transfer ocupation</font>.<br1>
- A <font color=LEVEL>Hero</font> character can submit the class-change request only after the Hero period has ended.<br1>
- If your character is carrying <font color=LEVEL>80 items or more</font> in its inventory, the change will fail.
<br>
<font color=LEVEL>Cross-Race Limitations</font><br>
- Characters whose main class is a <font color=LEVEL>Warsmith, Maestro, Overlord, or Dominator</font> are not eligible for this event.<br1>
- If you have both <font color=LEVEL>Elf and Dark Elf</font> classes as your subclasses, you cannot request one of them to be your main class since both of them can't have the opposing race's class as a subclass.
<br>
<font color=LEVEL>Kamael Class Limitations</font><br>
The Kamael race's Inspector and Judicator are subclass-only by design, so they cannot be changed into a main class. The Kamael have unique occupations that are directly tied to the character's gender, so when you change a Kamael character's class, the gender also changes automatically. For example: If your Kamael character is female and you choose to change your main class to a Berserker, your character's gender will change to male.<br>
